# ALJOS - Automated Linux Journal OS
A series of scripts created to automate the building of an updated version of Linux Journal OS.

## Linux Journal OS
Written by Petros Koutoupis in 2018, LJOS was written as a guide to creating the most basic Linux based operating system as possible (within reason), inspired by Linux From Scratch (LFS). https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/diy-build-custom-minimal-linux-distribution-source

This project aims to make the building of LJOS automatic and trivially extendable and updatable.
Please feel free to fork this project to create your own minimal (or not so minimal) Linux based perating system!
